<h2>January 14, 1997</h2>

<p>
<b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b>, as the <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> on September 12, 1996.
</p><p>
Initially code-named "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <b><i>Netscape's blink</i></b> element and <b><i>Microsoft's</i></b> marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.
</p><p>
 A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.
