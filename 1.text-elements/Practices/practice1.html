    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1> 
<p>
<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
<p>
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
</p>
<p>
It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

<h1><i>Cascading Style Sheets</i></h1> 
<p>
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. 
</p>
<p>
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
The name <i>cascading</i> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading <b>priority</b> scheme is predictable.
